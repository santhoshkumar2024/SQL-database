2]  What is DataBase?

                  DataBase  is nothing but organized form of data, It allows us to store, access , retrive , mnipulate , manage date in easily and effective manner.
                  DataBase is collection of data we can access the data in a digital format from remote and local computer system.
                  DataBase can be vast and complex, and such databases are developed using fixed design and modeling approaches
                  DataBase is a collection or group of related data.IT contains tables, views , stored procedures.

                        ex: College Management Database system  
                            School Management Database system.

What is MS SQL ?

Full form of SQL Structured Query Language.
It was developed at IBM company by Donald D. Chamberline and Reymond F. Boyce.
Standard of writing queries in a Language format is called SQL.
Standard  Language for STORING , RETRIVING , MANIPULATING data in a database or Realational database.
SQL is used to communicate with a database.
It is the standard language for relational database management systems. It is especially useful in handling organized data comprised of entities (variables) and relations between different entities of the data

            SQL commands are grouped into four major categories depending on their functionality:

       SQL commands are instructions, coded into SQL statements, which are used to communicate with the database to perform specific tasks, work, functions and queries with data.

              SQL commands can be used not only for searching the database but also to perform various other functions like, for                       example, you can create tables, add data to tables, or modify data, drop the table, set permissions for users.

            Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.

Data Definition Language (DDL)
                full form required
                These SQL commands are used for creating, modifying, and dropping the structure of database objects. The commands are                   CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME, and TRUNCATE.


Data Manipulation Language (DML)
                full form required

                    These SQL commands are used for storing, retrieving, modifying, and deleting data.
                    These Data Manipulation Language commands are: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.


Transaction Control Language (TCL)

          These SQL commands are used for managing changes affecting the data. These commands are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.


Data Control Language (DCL)
These SQL commands are used for providing security to database objects. These commands are GRANT and REVOKE.




                            The following SQL commands are frequently used in SQL queries.

                                                SQL SELECT
                                                SQL DISTINCT

                                                SQL IN
                                                SQL BETWEEN

                                                SQL GROUP BY
                                                SQL HAVING
                                                SQL ALIAS
                                                SQL AS
                                                SQL SELECT UNIQUE
